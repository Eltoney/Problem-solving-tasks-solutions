# traning-for-interviews
I am starting training and practicing problems for interviews so this to keep track of solved problems  

The strucute is :
there is a folder for each problem with the problem name , inside the folder there is a read me file that contain the problem link and my approch to the problem.
The folder also contains my solution files , mainly i solve problems using c++ so there will be always a file for the c++ solution and if i solved the problem with another language its file will be in the folder too
